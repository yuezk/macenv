# macenv
Set environment variables for GUI applications in macOS.

## Install/Update

```bash
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/yuezk/macenv/main/macenv > $HOME/.macenv && chmod +x $HOME/.macenv
```

## Usage

```bash
~/.macenv set JAVA_HOME /path/to/java/home
```

Then relaunch your GUI apps to make them aware. For command line apps, launch a new Terminal session.

**NOTE: The environment variables set by this tool will be persisted during OS restarting. If you found it doesnâ€™t take effect after the OS restarts, please try to relaunch your GUI applications because there is some delay before the environment variables take effect.**

View the available options with `~/.macenv --help`.

## Uninstall

```
~/.macenv --uninstall
rm -rf ~/.macenv
